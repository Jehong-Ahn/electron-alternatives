# electron-alternatives

## [electron](https://electronjs.org)
* Lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
* It is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) & [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org).

## Why electron-alternatives?

* Large size
* Resource (RAM) hogging
* Source code protection (https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/basic-electron-framework-exploitation)
* We would already have a web component in the system that can be used.

List of alternatives to [electron](https://electronjs.org)

Consider **Progressive Web Apps** [(PWA)](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/desktop), if your app doesn't require any platform interactions.

# JS
* [carlo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo) (Requires Node & Google Chrome to be installed on the system to run)
* [NW.js](https://nwjs.io) (Similar to electron, [provides Source code protection](https://nwjs.io/blog/js-src-protect-perf/))
* [DeskGap](https://deskgap.com) (bundles a Node.js runtime and leaves the HTML rendering to the operating system‘s webview)
* [Neutralinojs](https://neutralino.js.org) (chromium module is replaced with either user’s web browser or built-in browser component. Node run-time is replaced with a lightweight web server which exposes native OS functionality)
* [Proton Native](https://proton-native.js.org) (does the same to desktop that React Native did to mobile, based on https://github.com/parro-it/libui-node)
* [React Native Desktop](https://github.com/status-im/react-native-desktop) (Cross-platform React Native Desktop port based on Qt framework)
* [Vuido](https://github.com/mimecorg/vuido) (creating native desktop applications based on Vue.js, based on https://github.com/parro-it/libui-node)
* [NodeGui](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui) (powered by Qt5, [NodeGui-React](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui))
